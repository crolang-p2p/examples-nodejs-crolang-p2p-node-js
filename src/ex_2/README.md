## Learning Objectives
This example focuses on the fundamental step of connecting a node to the [CrolangP2P Broker](https://github.com/crolang-p2p/crolang-p2p-broker). It explains:

- What the Broker is: the [CrolangP2P Broker](https://github.com/crolang-p2p/crolang-p2p-broker) is a scalable socket server that forms the backbone of the Crolang project. Nodes authenticate and connect to the Broker, establishing a communication channel with it.  
  When a Node intends to connect with another Node, the Broker facilitates the exchange of signaling messages between
  the two Nodes (which are not yet directly connected via P2P). This process enables both Nodes to gather the necessary  information to establish a P2P connection. Essentially, the Broker acts as a known intermediary for the initial handshake, allowing Nodes to discover each other and negotiate the parameters for a direct, peer-to-peer connection. For more details, see the documentation in the [broker repository](https://github.com/crolang-p2p/crolang-p2p-broker).
- For each node ID, only one client with that ID can be connected to the Broker at a time. If you try to connect a second client with the same ID, the Broker will reject the connection. This ensures that each node in the network has a unique identity and avoids conflicts.
- In this example, there is no authentication required to connect to the Broker. This is done for simplicity. Authentication and security topics will be covered in a future example.
- How to connect to the Broker using the CrolangP2P library, and how to handle possible connection errors (e.g., duplicate IDs, unsupported client versions, authorization failures).

- Constants.ts: Common constants (IDs, broker address).

## Example Overview
In this scenario, Alice attempts to connect to the [CrolangP2P Broker](https://github.com/crolang-p2p/crolang-p2p-broker) using her unique node ID. The Broker acts as a central point for node registration and discovery. The connection process includes:

- Attempting to connect to the Broker at a specified address with a given node ID.
- Handling various connection errors, such as:
    - The local client is already connected.
    - Another client with the same ID is already connected.
    - The client version is not supported by the Broker.
    - Unauthorized connection attempts.
    - Socket or configuration errors.
- Upon successful connection, Alice is registered with the Broker and can be discovered by other nodes for P2P communication.

This example demonstrates the importance of the [Broker](https://github.com/crolang-p2p/crolang-p2p-broker) in the CrolangP2P architecture and shows how to robustly handle the connection process in your node implementation. For further documentation, refer to the broker repository.

## Running the example
### 1: Start Node Alice

In the project root, run:

```sh
npm run ex2Alice
```
