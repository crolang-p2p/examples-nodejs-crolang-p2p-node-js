## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to enable and configure node authentication in CrolangP2P using a broker extension.
- Learn how to pass custom authentication data from the node to the broker and extension.
- See how to run a multi-service CrolangP2P system with authentication using Docker Compose.

## Involved Files
- Ex_12_Alice.ts: Example node that connects to the broker, sending authentication data.
- docker-compose.yml: Defines and launches both the broker and authentication extension services.
- [server.js](https://github.com/crolang-p2p/examples-crolang-p2p-authentication-extension/blob/main/server.js): The authentication extension server implementation.

## Example Overview
This example shows how to:
- Launch a CrolangP2P broker and an authentication extension as separate services using Docker Compose.
- Configure the broker to delegate authentication to the extension via the `NODES_AUTHENTICATION_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.
- Pass custom authentication data from the node to the broker using the `onConnectionAttemptData` parameter (as a string).
- Use a sample authentication extension that expects a JSON string with `password` and `token` fields, and authenticates only if both are correct.

### How Authentication Works
- The broker is configured to call the authentication extension at `/authenticate-node` for every node connection attempt.
- The node (see `Ex_12_Alice.ts`) sends a JSON string as `onConnectionAttemptData` (e.g., `{ "token": "magic-token", "password": "unicorns" }`).
- The broker forwards this data to the extension, which parses it and checks credentials.
- **In this example, the authentication extension api contained in (`server.js`) checks that:**
    - The node id is exactly `Alice`
    - The password is exactly `unicorns`
    - The token is exactly `magic-token`
- Only if all three checks pass, the node is authenticated and allowed to connect to the Broker.
- The Node's id is automatically provided by the framework, onConnectionAttempt data can contain additional data (such as token and password in this example)
- The format and logic of `onConnectionAttemptData` are fully customizable: the extension can implement any logic and data structure you need.

> **How to setup extensions:**
> For more details on how to configure and link extensions to the broker, see the [CrolangP2P Broker documentation](https://github.com/crolang-p2p/crolang-p2p-broker). This example assumes the broker is already configured to use the authentication extension via the `NODES_AUTHENTICATION_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable in the provided `docker-compose.yml`.

## Running the Example
1. **Start the system** (from the `ex_12` directory):
   ```sh
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This will launch both the broker and the authentication extension, with the broker configured to use the extension for node authentication.

2. **Run the example node** (in another terminal, from the project root):
   ```sh
   npm run ex12Alice
   ```
   You should see output indicating whether authentication succeeded or failed.

3. **Stop the system:**
   Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running Docker Compose, then run:
   ```sh
   docker compose down
   ```
